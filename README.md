# Copy-Trading-Software
This is the demo project to show how to create Copy Trading Software for trading.

In this project, I've configured my code for Zerodha APIs. If you are using some other broker, then u need to change the mechanism. You can refee their respective website, where they will provide information on how to consume their APIs.

Steps to use Copy Trade Software:
1. Before running this program, everyday we need to generate Request Token for the APIs.
2. After u get the request tokens, enter them in the 'Trade Constants' file, where there are variable declared to have request tokens.
3. Make sure that, you have entered the valid Trading Symbol, eg: 'BANKNIFTY23420' in respective trading acount files.
4. Once you make sure, above information is valid, then you can run the program & if everything is correct, you will get below message displayed on console: 'User info fetched successfully for all users! I'm ready to Take your Trades now :)'
5. Now you are ready to take your trades!

To execute the trade:
- Need to provide the options in excel. I've shared the reference excel sheet in the code itself 'Reference_excel_for_copy_trade.xls'.
- To know, how to use excel sheet for executing trades, you can watch this video, where I've share complete details:
